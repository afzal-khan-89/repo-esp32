CMake Error at /home/afzal-khan/esp/esp-idf/tools/cmake/build.cmake:519 (message):
  WARNING: Component name "espressif/esp32-camera" doesn't match the
  directory name "mCamera-esp32".

  ESP-IDF CMake build system uses directory names as names of components, so
  different names may break requirements resolution.  To avoid the problem
  rename the component directory to "esp32-camera" or
  "espressif__esp32-camera"

  ERROR: Some components (espressif/mdns) in the "managed_components"
  directory were modified on the disk since the last run of the CMake.
  Content of this directory is managed automatically.

  If you want to keep the changes, you can move the directory with the
  component to the "components"directory of your project.

  I.E.  for "espressif__mdns" run:

  mv
  /home/afzal-khan/esp/projects/mCamera-esp32/mProject/esp-camera-teton/managed_components/espressif__mdns
  /home/afzal-khan/esp/projects/mCamera-esp32/mProject/esp-camera-teton/components/espressif__mdns


  Or, if you want to discard the changes remove the ".component_hash" file
  from the component's directory.

  I.E.  for "espressif__mdns" run:

  rm
  /home/afzal-khan/esp/projects/mCamera-esp32/mProject/esp-camera-teton/managed_components/espressif__mdns/.component_hash
